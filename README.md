This repository is dedicated to the study of aggregate losses, i.e. random sums of random variables with a given distribution.
A simple Monte Carlo method is used to sample the distribution of aggregate losses.
Then, a collection of typical risk measures with confidence intervals and methods to compute tail index can be used to study the properties of these sums.
